## What it Means to Gig

While gig work seems more ubiquitous than ever, the number of workers in the United States that participate in this market remains low compared to typical employment.

The exact breakdown of who is using apps like Uber, Lyft, Postmates, Amazon Flex, or TaskRabbit varies greatly based on age, race, and household income. According to [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/12/08/the-state-of-gig-work-in-2021/), in 2021 up to 16% of U.S. adults have been paid using an online gig platform. [Zippia](https://www.zippia.com/advice/gig-economy-statistics/#:~:text=According%20to%20our%20extensive%20research,36%25%20of%20the%20U.S.%20workforce.) explains that **36% of the workforce** were actively gigging in 2020.

These are some serious numbers indicating huge demand for temporary workers. We're talking over five percent of the GDP, okay?!

Since gig work has a coin flip's chance of being a part of your career path (if it isn't already), let's get into why you should set up your business with a two-hour minimum in place.

> [!Note]
> This post is for workers who **set their own rates** in response to the market. Uber/Lyft/Grubhub/Postmates rates are not determined by the worker. Many gig workers use multiple platforms to minimize downtime. Some do this on the side of a full-time or part-time job, while others combine gig work with larger freelance projects.

While most workers report that gig work is side-income, only a third do this full-time. If you are aiming to successfully be a part of that small slice of workers - _3% of the U.S. workforce_ - then you need to think carefully about your rates.

## Why Gig?

A lot of workers enjoy the flexibility that comes with being your own boss, and it's easier than ever to start. Sure, a platform like TaskRabbit or Upwork will collect a fee for connecting you with clients, however it should not be undervalued how much marketing these platforms pay for which builds trust. Trust is crucial when you work largely with strangers.

This is a good time to note that many, if not all of these platforms will perform a background check when you sign-up and paying a fee for this is not unusual.

Transitioning from traditional employment can be overwhelming at first, as there is a lot to learn about operating as an independent contractor - especially the money part. How you are taxed and how you obtain benefits are completely different processes now.

In the U.S., this means you are not an employee for a company, instead _you are the company_. Successful companies excel at delivering their specialty in a convenient and reliable manner.

Now, calling yourself a company can seem silly while you glide down 5th Avenue on your e-bike with a grass-fed burger and shake for Amanda in SoHo, but it is **the most important distinction to clarify**. My recommendation is to not stay solely in the side of the gig economy where you have no control over the rates.

To me, not having a say in what I charge feels too much like working for employee wages without any employee benefits. You need to find a skill where you set your own rates. You might already have this skill - check out the in-demand categories on an app like TaskRabbit and consider setting up a profile!

Back in 2018, I did some Postmates deliveries for a few months to test out the system - it is harsh and there is no way to grow. This is ultimately what pushed me towards brushing up on my furniture assembly, mounting, and moving skills on TaskRabbit.

You can argue that there is not really room to grow with a platform like TaskRabbit either. If full-time independence is your goal, you will need to also freelance on larger projects to supplement your gig income.

It's either that or time to give up your sweet autonomy for _the man_. For real, though, there is nothing wrong with gigging full-time or working a W2 job while gigging.

## Why Two Hour Minimum is Non-Negotiable

Fields where it is common to see two-hour minimums enforced include:

- Movers
- Electricians
- Plumbers
- Translators
- IT professionals
- Copywriters

Quite a few of these positions require you to travel to new locations, often for only an hour two of work. It is easy to spend more time scoping, preparing, and travelling to a job than it will take you to complete the task.

### How a Minimum Helps Your Business

- **You need to be able to deliver** consistent results for your clients in order to build up a positive reputation.
- **This is easier to do if you have better baseline** pay coming in for each job.
- **Giving away tiny chunks** of your time will only benefit the client and never benefit you.
  - **Have you ever traveled 2 hours** for a job that took 30 minutes to complete?
  - **If you want to only charge the client for "one hour"**, raise your rates to protect your baseline.

As for how to explain this to clients, we will cover that a bit later on. The message can be quickly summed up by the following quote from a moving business based in London.

> The reality for both movers and customers is sometimes you win a bit, sometimes you lose a little, but the two hour minimum charge is really the only practical and viable way to provide an ongoing London wide removals service that can be depended on.

## Let's Do Some Math

Let's say you work 250 days in a year. Some might argue that the actual is closer to 260, although let's keep in mind that your demand is far from consistent as a gig worker.

How much pay do you need to earn each of those days for gig work to be your full-time?

Well, $100 likely wont cut it, since I don't know many adults in the US _willing_ to get by on $25,000 per year before taxes. At this level you're still competing against minimum wage and might wake up wondering whether you'd be better off with the security that comes from an employer.

Let us not deliberate such possibilities. **You** are a total boss in search of _more_.

Bumping up to $150 each work day brings yearly pay before taxes to $37,500 which is beginning to look desirable.

Until you're clearing an average of $200 or more each working day of the year to reach $50,000, you might not be satisfied. The current rate of inflation has many workers feeling vulnerable and worried whether their income can keep up with rising costs.

| Daily Earning | Yearly Gross |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| $100          | $25,000      |
| $150          | $37,500      |
| $200          | $50,000      |
| $300          | $75,000      |
| $500          | $125,000     |

_Your daily earnings are likely to fluctuate, so keeping a chart like this can help you estimate. \*Based on 250 working days._

Remember, as an independent contractor, this is the whole pie. There are no bonuses, 401k-matches, stock options, or health insurance plans on top of your take-home pay. I know many readers don't need this reminder, but these are perks that your clients may not think of when balking at your minimum.

What you can charge and the level of demand for your work depend on individual circumstances. Let's say that we're doing these calculations in a populous US city. These are the areas where gig workers naturally find most demand.

Imagine, for a moment, proclaiming that you are now open for business in Brisbee, Arizona, population: 5,209:

_Source: The Travel, "12 Cities With The Least Population In The USA"_

You don't have to be a statistician to understand why your odds will be better in a city with with 20 times more people. Or 1500 times more people.

When choosing a life of gig work and freelance you have to first consider how realistic this plan is given your area's population level, average income, and whether this can be something you're even able to do full-time. I have yet to explore the nomadic freelance lifestyle, and perhaps that is where untapped potential lies. #nomadlife

## How to Market the Minimum

Some clients will protest that they do not need you for two hours, and this might be true. What they do need is for someone to be reliable, and that requires them to pay a certain premium for your work.

Do make sure you **always get confirmation in writing** from your client before the job starts so that there can be no ambiguity. On the platform TaskRabbit, there is an option to turn on "I have a 2 hour minimum". In a reddit thread about this feature, one redditor even offers an approach to confirming your minimum with prospective clients:

![](/public/images/taskrabbit-reddit-two-hour-comment.png)

There will always be some clients that ghost when you mention a minimum. This behavior is precisely what prompted me to put this writing together. When you are negotiating with a client who is looking for the cheapest deal possible, chances are that this client will be difficult to satisfy _no matter how great your performance_.

I would go further to guess that clients that "_just have 45 minutes of simple work :(_" have never offered their services as an gig worker.

Instantiating a two-hour minimum is a simple way to filter out clients who may be harder to work with than they're worth. In almost all forms of gig work today, your reputation is on the line with **each job you accept**.

Now, if the pushback in your particular market is so strong that you worry about all of your jobs drying up for declaring a minimum, then perhaps it is wise to see if clients will compromise for a 1.5 hour minimum. Most of these clients are fully prepared to pay for your time should you use over two hours - they simply are looking for the best deal possible.

If you do decide to entertain clients for "only an hour" or so, do be sure to boost your rate accordingly. This will have a compounding effect on longer jobs, and could be the push you need to consider billing methods that are not based on hours and minutes and instead based on projects and results.

## Future Goal: Decoupling from the Clock

We've spent a while discussing why freelancers should be charging a minimum of _at least_ two hours for their skills.

Once this is achieved, I think the next step is to start thinking about how to become free from the clock. This means thinking about day rates, project rates, and retainers. These are the keys to shifting your career, allowing you to expand your focus while charging higher rates.

This will likely mean expanding on your current skills and taking on true freelance work. Maybe that's writing, cooking, coding, designing, consulting - this should be something you could see growing over time.

Yes, this path leads to more difficult work and success might be harder to earn. You may not be able to secure a project rate to mount two televisions or assemble an IKEA bedframe - this is where I suggest you introduce two-hour minimums or flat-rates for a large task. For clients who reach out to me directly for similar tasks, I offer flat-rates for a half or full day.

A flat-rate helps the client feel at ease with the budget, however it becomes your job to be explicit about what those chunks of time will include - and what happens when time goes over or new deliverables are added to the agenda.

Without an organizing party to handle business policies, it is up to you what happens when a client cancels at the last minute. Without a contract, you will not receive any fees for your trouble.

Raising rates is an essential part of being your own boss, but it doesn't have to be a painful or confusing process. I hope this guide helps you navigate your journey as an independent contractor.

I leave you with this quote by Warren Buffet that has been bandied all over the web and it seems no one can remember when he said it. If you do know, please email me to settle this once and for all.

Once you've set up the gig + freelance + job workflow of your dreams, it's a good time to start planning for the future. Perhaps it's time to look into SEP-IRA accounts or setting up an LLC.

Also, make sure to take a quick breather.
