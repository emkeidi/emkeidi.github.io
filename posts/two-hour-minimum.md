# Do you have time to learn a freelancing superpower that will maximize your business in 2022?

Have you been working in the world of gigs and tasks? If so, you know it can be tough, rewarding work that requires constant flexibility. Read on to learn about a simple superpower for managing client flow that many of today's freelancers could use a refresher on.

> _This applies best for workers on a platform like TaskRabbit, where you set your own rates across a range of skill sets._

While gig work seems is more ubiquitous than ever, the number of workers in the United States that participate in this market remains low compared to typical employment.

According to [Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/12/08/the-state-of-gig-work-in-2021/) in 2021, up to 16% of Americans have been paid using an online gig platform. The exact breakdown of who is using apps like Uber, Lyft, Postmates, Amazon Flex, or TaskRabbit vary greatly based on age, race, and household income. Without looking too far into the specifics, that's a sizable chunk of the workforce, so it's imperative that gig workers brush up on best practices.

While most workers report that gig work is side-income, only 3% currently do this full-time. If you are aiming to successfully be a part of that small slice of workers, I highly recommend you read on about billing practices.

A lot of workers enjoy the flexibility that comes with being your own boss, and it is easier today than ever to start! Sure, a platform like TaskRabbit will collect a fee for connecting you with clients, however it should not be undervalued how little canvassing is required of the modern gig worker.

Transitioning from traditional employment can be overwhelming at first, as there is a lot to learn about offering professional services - especially the money part. How you are taxed and how you obtain benefits are completely different processes now.

In the United States, this means you will not be an employee for a company, instead you will _be the company_. Successful companies excel at delivering their specialty in a convenient and reliable manner.

Now, this can sound silly when you're gliding down 5th Avenue with a grass-fed burger and shake for Amanda in SoHo, but it is **the most important distinction to clarify**.
