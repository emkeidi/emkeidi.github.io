## What it means to gig

While gig work seems is more ubiquitous than ever, the number of workers in the United States that participate in this market remains low compared to typical employment.

According to [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/12/08/the-state-of-gig-work-in-2021/), in 2021 up to 16% of Americans have been paid using an online gig platform. The exact breakdown of who is using apps like Uber, Lyft, Postmates, Amazon Flex, or TaskRabbit vary greatly based on age, race, and household income. Without looking too far into the specifics, that's a sizable chunk of the workforce, so it's imperative that gig workers brush up on best practices.

While most workers report that gig work is side-income, only a third do this full-time. If you are aiming to successfully be a part of that small slice of workers - _3% of the US workforce_- then I highly recommend you read on about how and why you need to charge a two hour minimum.

A lot of workers enjoy the flexibility that comes with being your own boss, and it is easier today than ever to start! Sure, a platform like TaskRabbit or Upwork will collect a significant fee for connecting you with clients, however it should not be undervalued how little canvassing is required of the modern gig worker.

Transitioning from traditional employment can be overwhelming at first, as there is a lot to learn about offering professional services - especially the money part. How you are taxed and how you obtain benefits are completely different processes now.

In the United States, this means you will not be an employee for a company, instead you will _be the company_. Successful companies excel at delivering their specialty in a convenient and reliable manner.

Now, this can sound silly when you're gliding down 5th Avenue with a grass-fed burger and shake for Amanda in SoHo, but it is **the most important distinction to clarify**.

## Why Two Hour Minimum is Non-negotiable

- you need to be able to deliver consistently for your clients in order to build up a positive reputation.
- Giving away tiny chunks of your time will only benefit the client and never benefit you.
  - Have you ever travelled 2 hours for a job that took 30 minutes to complete?
  - While charging a 1 hour minimum for such a task is catching on in some cities, I strongly urge freelances to always charge a 2 hour minimum.

As for how to explain this to clients, we will cover that a bit later on. The message can be quickly summed up by the following quote from a moving business based in London.

> The reality for both Movers and customers is sometimes you win a bit, sometimes you lose a little, but the two hour minimum charge is really the only practical and viable way to provide an ongoing London wide removals service that can be depended on.

## Let's Do Some Math

In a given year, let's use **250 work days** as an example . Some might argue that the actual is closer to 260, although let's keep in mind that your demand is far from consistent as a freelancer. 250 days of pay means securing work about 21 days per month. Chances are you won't hit this number exactly, especially when just starting out.

How much pay do you need to earn each of those days for freelance to be your full-time?

Well, $100 likely wont cut it, since I don't know many adults in the US _willing_ to get by on $25,000 per year before taxes. At this level you're still competing against minimum wage and might wake up wondering whether you'd be better off with the security that comes from an employer.

Let us not deliberate such possibilities. **You** are a total boss in search of _more_.

Bumping up to $150 each work day brings yearly pay before taxes to $37,500 which is beginning to look desirable.

Until you're clearing an average of $200 or more each working day of the year to reach $50,000, you might not be satisfied. The current rate of inflation has many workers feeling vulnerable and worried whether their income can keep up with rising costs.

| Daily Earning | Yearly Gross |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| $100          | $25,000      |
| $150          | $37,500      |
| $200          | $50,000      |
| $300          | $75,000      |
| $500          | $125,000     |

_Your daily earnings are likely to fluctuate, so keeping a chart like this can help you estimate. \*Based on 250 working days._

Remember, as a freelancer, this is the whole pie. There are no bonuses, 401k-matches, stock options, or health insurance on top of your take-home. I know many reading don't need this reminder, but these are perks that your clients may not think of when balking at your minimum.

What you can charge and the level of demand for your work depend on individual circumstances. Let's say that we're doing these calculations in a populous US city. These are the areas where freelancers naturally find most demand.

Imagine, for a moment, proclaiming that you are now open for business in Brisbee, Arizona:

When choosing a life of freelance you have to first consider how realistic this plan is given your area's population level, average income, and whether this can be something you're even able to do full-time.

## How to market the minimum

Some clients will protest that they do not need you for two hours, and this might be true.

## Future Goal: Decoupling from the Clock

We've spent a while discussing why freelancers should be charging a minimum of _at least_ two hours for their skills.

Once this is achieved, I think the next step is start thinking about how to become free from the clock.

Whatever your personal opinion might be of the billionaire class, I think many American workers have been influenced by the concept of passive income.

This quote by Warren Buffet has been bandied all over the web and it seems no one can remember when he said it. If you do know, please email me to settle this once and for all.
