# Help, there's too much information.

Yes, that is a common feeling in 2022. Curious minds will find that there is simply never any chance that they will run out of news to ingest.

With all of this coming at us, it's understandable to become a bit lax about what news passes our harried filters and burrows deep within our psyches. What the news does once there is both unknowable and informs the core of our being.

Think about the fact that any given day you have the chance to fill some of your head with:

- the internet (yes, like this post)
- the socials (also the internet, but crustier)
  - do you follow only people you know, or have you allowed more _influencers_ and _personalities_ in, who depend on your rapt attention for a living?
- television news
